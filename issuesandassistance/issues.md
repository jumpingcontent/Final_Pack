Through the semester I opened and closed some issues on github.

------------------------------

First I'll go over the open issues:

On https://github.com/LouVang97/Week8-Script/issues/3 I mentioned and corrected a typo a classmate made on an other good submission.

On https://github.com/bigmantate/wk8review/issues/1 I gave some input to a classmate on a bit of formatting to help their script be easier to read through.

On https://github.com/loknjinu13/week8/issues/5 I gave a classmate some input on editing part of a script to help it function better.

------------------------------

Here are also the closed issues:

On https://github.com/JUAREZZ/week8-REVIEW/issues/8 I gave a correction to help a classmate's files be better read by their script.

On https://github.com/loknjinu13/week8/issues/1 I gave input on my thoughts on folder creation lines in a classmate's script.
