This semester I enjoyed having a chance to give assistance to classmates on various topics. I felt that this collaboration is pretty crucial in helping each other learn more about both linux, server administration, and it's community.

I'd like to highlight these times:

- Near the beginning of the semester I helped a couple classmates seated near me in running and configuring their Virtualbox VMs. I helped them find the proper Debian .iso build that you mentioned we should download and showed them how to create a new VM, configure it settings and attach Debian as a live image, and basic steps on running Debian and most importantly reaching the terminal prompt.

- When we were beginning our github introductions I helped a classmate use the terminal to be able to commit, push, and pull with Github. I felt this helped him a lot with being able to learn how to use the terminal interface to work with Github in addition to the web interface.

- Around the midterm I helped a classmate with basic guidance on how to properly use Github. He was having some issues with the settings and various other parts of github and I showed him the proper steps to create and maintain a repo and also what to do to open up issues and close issues.
