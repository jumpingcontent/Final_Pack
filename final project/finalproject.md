For our final project we had quite an adventure. We had three attempts at a project and each one taught us a lot. I was the documenter for 
all three of our projects 

------------------------------------------

Our first project attempt is at: https://github.com/jumpingcontent/Wikinets_Research

I've also uploaded a .zip of this to this final pack folder as the wikinets.zip file.

For this project I documented the important steps that we've taken with helpful input and material from all my group members so that I would know what to write down. This was a solid shared effort and we learned a lot about Mediawiki. Sadly due to a server issues with PHP we couldn't continue this but the project is an interesting record of our effort.

------------------------------------------

Our second project attepmt is at: https://github.com/jumpingcontent/Wikinets_Moinmoin

I've also uploaded its .zip to ourmoinwiki.zip in this final pack folder.

For our second attempt we used the versatile and somewhat more simple Moinmoin engine to try and run a wiki. I documented the material that my group members gave and we also made it to having a working deployment but were just a step away due to an issue with apache.

-----------------------------------------

And our attempt and thankfully successful one is at: https://github.com/jumpingcontent/Postfixers

Also upload to postfixers.zip in this final pack folder.

In this attempt we learned about and documented the Postfix deployment on the sootsplash server. We had some issues at first before we learned the proper configuration steps and commands that I documented in our repo with help from my group members. We successfully configured the Postfix deployment and managed to send and receive emails that worked for all classmates who entered sootsplash from their terminal.
