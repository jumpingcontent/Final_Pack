For our final project we had quite an adventure. We had three attempts at a project and each one taught us a lot. I was the documenter for 
all three of our projects 

------------------------------------------

Our first project attempt is at: https://github.com/jumpingcontent/Wikinets_Research

I've also uploaded a .zip of this to this final pack folder as the wikinets.zip file.

For this project I documented the important steps that we've taken with helpful input and material from all my group members so that I would know what to write down. This was a solid shared effort and we learned a lot about Mediawiki. Sadly due to a server issues with PHP we couldn't continue this but the project is an interesting record of our effort.

------------------------------------------

Our second project attepmt is at: https://github.com/jumpingcontent/Wikinets_Moinmoin

I've also uploaded its .zip to ourmoinwiki.zip in this final pack folder.
