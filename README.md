# Final_Pack

Here is my final pack for our CSCI 2461-70 Linux class.

To begin, I've included each lab/weekly assignment that I've done in its own folder in the proper format.

I've also made an "attendance" folder that outlines my attendance for the semester.

Also, in the final project folder I've detailed my contributions to our group's final project.
